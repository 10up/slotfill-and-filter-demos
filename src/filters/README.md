# Filters

Filters as a concept is not new to WordPress. It is a paradigm that allows code to interact or modify other code.
To leverage Filters in Gutenberg, we will need to use the [@wordpress/hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/hooks) api.

Please see the [offical docs](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/filters/) for more details.
