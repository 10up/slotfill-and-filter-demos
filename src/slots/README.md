## Gutenberg SlotFills

Slotfills can be defined as components that have been exposed to allow developers to inject items into some predefined places in the Gutenberg admin experience.

In order to use them, we must leverage the [@wordpress/plugins](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/packages/packages-plugins/) api to register a plugin that will inject our items. Please refer to the documentation linked above for more detail.
