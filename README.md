# Gutenberg SlotFill and Filter demos

> This repo can be used as reference or can be installed as a plugin in any WordPress install to make code changes as needed.
Each slotfill or filter is explained and has an example. This is meant to be a working document and will change as Gutenberg does and as I learn.
