# Gutenberg SlotFill and Filter demos

This repo can be used as reference or can be installed as a plugin in any WordPress install to make code changes as needed.
Each slotfill or filter is explained and has an example.

This is meant to be a working document and will change as Gutenberg does and as I learn.

## Sections

* [SlotFills](./src/slots)
* [Filters](./src/filters)
* [FAQ](./src/faq)

## Local setup

1. Clone this repository into the plugin directory of a WordPress installation.
2. Run `npm install` from the root of the plugin.
3. Run `npm run dev` to compile the files and tell webpack to watch for changes.
